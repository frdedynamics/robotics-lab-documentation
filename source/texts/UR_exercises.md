We have an UR5e and an older UR5 CB2.1 (upgraded CB in 2019). This means that the e-series execises will fit perferctly, but the CB3 exercises will have a mismatch with CB2.1. The mismatch is not too big.

Take care to consider if you will be spending time on the UR5e or UR5, and prioritize which exercises to take. Every single one of them is recommended.
