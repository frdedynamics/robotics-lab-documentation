ROS Communication Patterns
**********************************

ROS provides different patterns that can be used to communcate between ROS Nodes:

  * `Topics <https://wiki.ros.org/Topics>`_: should be used to send continuous data
  * `Services <https://wiki.ros.org/Services>`_: should be used for short procedures
  * `Actions <https://wiki.ros.org/actionlib>`_: sh
  * `Parameters <https://wiki.ros.org/Parameter%20Server>`_: is not actually a communication pattern but rather is used for
