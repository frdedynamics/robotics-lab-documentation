An Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) gives you code completion and refactoring. It`s the best.

There are many IDE`s to choose from. Choose `JetBrains <https://www.jetbrains.com/>`_.

Get yourself a free account using your HVL email and install **JetBrains toolbox**. You get a lot of free stuff for educational use here as well.. alot!

Once you`ve installed the toolbox on W10, Ubuntu or MacOS, make sure you are logged in and select the IDE`s you want. Notice the seamless transitions when using your favourite JetBrains stuff in different OS`. Marvelous.

#. PyCharm Community Edition. We focus on python 2 for ROS, so install PyCharm and consider the Hatchery ROS plugin for fancy colors and stuff.
#. CLion, if you`re so inclined, for C/C++ ROS and Arduino fun.
#. DataGrip if you ever want to do some DB stuff.
#. IntelliJ IDEA Community for Java apps.
