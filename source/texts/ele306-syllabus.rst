***************************************
ELE306 ROS Syllabus
***************************************
The objectives of the ROS teaching for ELE306 are that students get experience with programming, modelling, simulating and controlling both mobile robots and robot manipulators with ROS. The skills learned will also be used as part of a semester project on designing a robotic system for a real-world challenge.

For the UR labs for ELE306 see link **TODO**.


**Get ready for ROS:**

- We recommend using the all-in-one virtual machine installation: :ref:`Install-VM`

**Generic ROS content and labs:**

- What is ROS? Why do we need it? Important commands: :ref:`ROS-Introduction`
- **Lab 4:** :ref:`Getting-Started-with-Turtlebots` - Turtlebot simulations
- File system in ROS and where to locate ROS packages: :ref:`File-System-in-ROS`
- Hands-on activities in ROS: :ref:`First-Package-Nodes-Launchers-Parameters`
- Simulation in ROS: :ref:`Gazebo-Tutorial`
- Visualization and robot modelling: :ref:`URDF-Tutorial`
- **Lab 5**: :ref:`Apply-on-Real-Turtlebot` - Turtlebot in real world
- TODO: Controlling the OM


**Project-specific ROS content**

- :ref:`with-Matlab`
- :ref:`MoveIt`
- **See Canvas for further information on the semester projects**
