ELE306 UR and ROS Syllabus
***************************************
The objective of the UR labs is to get students familiar with collaborative and industrial robot manipulators. The idea is to give a grasp of how to program them and solve simple tasks. 

The objectives of the ROS teaching for ELE306 are that students get experience with programming, modelling, simulating and controlling both mobile robots and robot manipulators with ROS. The skills learned will also be used as part of a semester project on designing a robotic system for a real-world challenge.

**UR5/UR5e activities**:

- **Lab 1**: :ref:`Basics-of-UR`
- **Lab 2**: :ref:`Features-and-Safety-Planes`
- **Lab 3**: :ref:`Advanced-UR`


**Get ready for ROS:**

- We recommend using the all-in-one virtual machine installation: :ref:`Install-VM`
- We recommend you to get familiar with `Linux terminal and basic commands <https://youtu.be/SkB-eRCzWIU>`_
- We also recommend you to know some `basic Python <https://youtu.be/VchuKL44s6E>`_.

**Generic ROS content and labs:**

- What is ROS? Why do we need it? Important commands: :ref:`ROS-Introduction`
- **Lab 4:** :ref:`Getting-Started-with-Turtlebots` - Turtlebot simulations
- File system in ROS and where to locate ROS packages: :ref:`File-System-in-ROS`
- Hands-on activities in ROS: :ref:`First-Package-Nodes-Launchers-Parameters`
- Simulation and Visualization Robots in ROS: :ref:`URDF_Gazebo_RViz`
- **Lab 5**: :ref:`Apply-on-Real-Turtlebot` - Turtlebot in real world
- TODO: Controlling the OM
