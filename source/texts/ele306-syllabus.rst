ELE306 Syllabus
***************************************
The main objective in this ROS series for ELE306 students is to create a baseline for them to apply both mobile robots and robot manipulators efficiently in the ROS environment.

Both mobile robots (with and without a manipulator on) and industrial robotic arms are covered adequately to enable students to get to know ROS environment, control different robot types both in a simulation environment and in real world. Moreover, students are aimed to be competent in effective problem solving in a case study (project).
