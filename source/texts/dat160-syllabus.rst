DAT160 ROS Syllabus
***************************************
The objectives of the ROS teaching for DAT160 are that students get experience with programming robots with ROS, and a platform for applying robot intelligence related algorithms (path finding, AR tag reading, navigation, SLAM etc.).

It is a mobile-robot centered collection that enables students to get to know the ROS environment, control multiple robots in the same simulation environment, and be competent in effective problem solving in a semester project (competition).

**Get ready for ROS:**

- We recommend using the all-in-one virtual machine installation: :ref:`Install-VM`

**Generic ROS content and labs:**

- What is ROS? Why do we need it? Important commands: :ref:`ROS-Introduction`
- **Lab 4:** :ref:`Getting-Started-with-Turtlebots` - Turtlebot simulations
- File system in ROS and where to locate ROS packages: :ref:`File-System-in-ROS`
- Hands-on activities in ROS: :ref:`First-Package-Nodes-Launchers-Parameters`
- Simulation and Visualization Robots in ROS: :ref:`URDF_Gazebo_RViz`
- **Lab 5**: :ref:`Apply-on-Real-Turtlebot` - Turtlebot in real world


**Project-specific ROS content**

- :ref:`AR-tags`
- :ref:`Navigation-From-Scratch`
- :ref:`Multiple-Robot-Control-in-Gazebo`
- **See Canvas for further information on the semester projects**
