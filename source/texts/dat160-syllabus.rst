DAT160 Syllabus
***************************************
The main objective in this ROS series for DAT160 students is to create a baseline for them to apply robot intelligence related algorithms (path finding, AR tag reading, navigation, SLAM etc.).

It is a mobile-robots centered collection which enables students to get to know ROS environment, control multiple robots in the same simulation environment and be competent in effective problem solving in a case study (competition).
