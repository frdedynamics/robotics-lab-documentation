# Lab 1

## Theme
1. Safety when using a UR robot.
1. Waypoints – different kinds.
1. Motion – MoveJ og MoveL.
1. End-effector – use of gripper and measurement of payload.
1. Simple programming for pick and place.

## Equipment
1. UR5 / UR5e robot with PolyScope (they are different, old/new).
1. Scale for measuring weights, with 1 gram resolution.
1. Robotiq 2-Finger Adaptive Robot Gripper / Hand-E Gripper
1. Lab station with .. TODO: fill this out

## Before the lab
1. Read thru "Introduction to UR" TODO: Add link
1. Do the following exercises on a virtual robot (or on an actual robot if you read the lab rules and signed for it):
    * First program; Sleep, page 25-30.
    * MoveJ vs MoveL, page 31-32.
    * Speed & Acceleration, page 39 (you do not need to do this for MoveP).
    * Singularity, page 41 (short, but very important. Try to find a way to avoid singularity).

**NOTE**: You do not need to bring simulations to the lab. Their intent is to prepare you for the lab.

## Report
There is no need to hand in a report after this lab.

Signed attendance will suffice as approved lab exercise.
