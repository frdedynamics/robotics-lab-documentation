Lab 1
****************************

Theme
==============================================

#. Waypoints.
#. Motion – MoveJ og MoveL.
#. End-effector – use of gripper.
#. Pick and place.

Equipment
==============================================
#. UR5 / UR5e robot with PolyScope (they are different, old/new).
#. Robotiq 2-Finger Adaptive Robot Gripper / Hand-E Gripper
#. Lab station with two boxes, two cups and a gripable object.

Before the lab
==============================================
#. Complete the `Universal Robots Academy <./UR_exercises.html>`_ ***<-- this is very important!***
#. If first time then contact lab-assistant/phd-fellow/teacher. Expect thorough follow up.
#. Travel to the `HVL Robotics Lab <https://www.google.com/maps/place/HVL+Robotics+Lab/@61.4590375,5.8326453,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4616333d5f3d88b5:0x2025abbba16257dd!8m2!3d61.459035!4d5.8348393>`_
#. Read and sign the lab rules.
#. Have all the fun with robots! If stuck then ask for help.


Report
==============================================
There is no need to hand in a report after this lab.

Signed attendance will suffice as approved lab exercise.

Tasks
==============================================
#. Repeat Universal Robots Academy Task 4. Creating a program, but this time on a real robot.

    #. Make a triangle using MoveJ, then using MoveL, and finally using MoveP.
    #. Pick up a real box, place it somewhere else.

#. Repeat Universal Robots Academy Task 10. You may find it in the *PRO Track* section of the 
   Universal Robots Academy - not in the *Core* section. The task is named feature coordinates.
   This time you will compute the task on a real robot and you decide the real/imaginary box.

Race pace
==============================================

Finally! A challenge. A series of demands are listed below, make a program to fulfill them. Make your program both as fast and smooth as possible. This is a contest!

#. Build the course in the picture below.
#. Place the object in box C.
#. Make the start position for the robot straight up, pointing to the sky.
#. Pick up the object
#. Move between the two cups B, not over!
#. Place object in box A

Questions
==============================================

#. What is this thing UR calls "Feature"?

    #. Which ones did you use?
    #. Where were their respective origo?
    #. What is their use?

#. What is MoveJ, MoveL and MoveP? Describe the difference, and when to use what.
#. What was your fastest race time?
